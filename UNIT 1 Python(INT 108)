Language is a tool for communication.

in this learning program, we use English to give instructions and share information with learners

Similarly, computer programming languages communicate with computers by providing instructions

These Programming languages help us represent data like numbers, text, and images and also provide instructions to

work with that data.

You don't need to be a computer science expert or a math genius to write a computer program. If you understand

basic logic, you can write computer programs easily There are many programming languages available. In our course, we will learn a programming language called

Python.

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language for general-purpose programming

In English to greet someone, you say "Hellol". Similarly in Spanish, one would say "Hola!"

For example, if we want the computer to display a greeting message, we provide instructions in a computer programming language. In Python we provide instructions in the belowe format

print("Hello!")

The above text is called source code or simply code. Since it is written in Python, it is called Python code.

The above code represents a simple Python program which prints. "Hello!"

n the above case, we have provided some instructions in a computer programming language to the computer to display a greeting message. This sequence of instructions is called a program
